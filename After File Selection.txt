UI State: After File Upload
What Changed from Previous State
The drag-and-drop/file picker area is replaced by a file preview card.
The uploaded file is displayed with its name, type, and size.
The user can now see their selected file and has the option to remove it (via the "X" icon on the file card).
The "Upload" button is now enabled (highlighted in blue), indicating the form is ready for submission.
