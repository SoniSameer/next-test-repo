UI Analysis: Left Drawer Plus Icon (Insert/Block Library)

Overall Layout
Left Drawer:
The drawer is now in "Insert" or "Block Library" mode, as indicated by the active plus icon at the top.
The content of the drawer has changed to display a set of draggable or selectable content blocks and layout elements.

Drawer Content
1. Block/Element Library
Basic Section:
The drawer displays a grid of block options under a "Basic" heading.
Each block is represented by an icon and a label, such as:
1 Column, 2 Column, 3 Column, 2 Column 3/7 (various layout structures)
Text (T icon)
Link (chain icon)
Image (picture icon)
Video (play icon)
(Other possible blocks not fully visible in the screenshot)

Interaction:
These blocks are likely draggable or clickable, allowing the user to insert new content or layout elements into the email/document.
The user can select a block and place it at the desired location in the main editor area.
Main Editor Area

Localized Content:
The right side remains the WYSIWYG editor with the localized document.
The user can insert new blocks from the left drawer into the document, enhancing or restructuring the content as needed.
Functionality

Content Insertion:
The user can add new layout structures (columns, rows), content types (text, image, video, link), and possibly other advanced blocks to the document.

Drag-and-Drop or Click-to-Insert:
The most common UX is drag-and-drop, but click-to-insert at the selected position is also possible.
Live Update:
Inserted blocks appear immediately in the main editor, ready for editing and styling.

Summary
The plus icon mode in the left drawer is an insertion panel or block library.
It allows users to enhance the document by adding new sections, columns, and content types.
This is a powerful feature for customizing the structure and content of localized emails or documents, similar to what you find in modern email builders or page editors.
