UI Analysis: Compare Drafts with Left Drawer Open

Overall Layout
Left: A dark, slide-out drawer/panel is open, showing a structured view of the document.
Center/Right: The main WYSIWYG editor with the localized content, as in previous screens.
Top: The page title is "Compare Drafts" with a "Submit for Approval" button.
Left Drawer (Panel)

How it Opens:
The drawer is opened by clicking the blue chevron (left arrow) on the sidebar. This is a common pattern for toggling navigation or utility panels.

Content of the Drawer:
The drawer displays a hierarchical tree view of the HTML document structure (DOM tree).
Elements are nested to reflect their structure in the HTML (e.g., Body > Div > Table > Table Row > Div, etc.).
Each element is labeled (Meta, Link, Div, Table, Text, etc.).
There are icons at the top of the drawer (pencil, stack, plus), indicating different modes or options.
Each element has an eye icon, likely for toggling visibility or focusing on that element in the editor.
The numbers on the right (e.g., 7, 1, 2, 3) may indicate the number of child elements or blocks.

Drawer Options (Tabs/Icons):
At the top of the drawer, there are three icons:
Pencil (‚úèÔ∏è): Likely represents "Edit" or "Structure" mode (currently selected).
Stacked Layers (üóÇÔ∏è): Could represent "Compare" or "Versions" mode.
Plus (+): Could represent "Add" or "Insert" mode.
These icons act as tabs or options to switch the drawer‚Äôs content or functionality.

Main Editor Area
Localized Content:
The right side shows the localized email in a WYSIWYG editor.
Each block is outlined and has an info ("i") button for metadata and traceability.
The editor toolbar appears when a block is selected, allowing formatting and block-level actions (move, delete, etc.).

Summary of Drawer Functionality
The left drawer provides advanced document navigation and editing tools.
The user can:
View and navigate the document‚Äôs structure.
Toggle visibility or focus on specific elements.
Switch between different drawer modes using the icons at the top.
This is especially useful for power users or when working with complex HTML documents.
