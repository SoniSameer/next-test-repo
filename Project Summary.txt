Project Summary: Localize Email Front-End

1. User Journey & Workflow
Landing/Dashboard:
Users are greeted with a clean dashboard and a call-to-action to "Localise Email."
File Upload:
Users upload an HTML email file, select the file format (currently "Email"), and choose the target country for localization.
Prompt/Rule Configuration:
After uploading, users configure localization instructions:
Review preset, locked rules (e.g., compliance, scientific accuracy).
Add or edit a custom prompt for nuanced localization needs.
Localization Processing:
On submitting, the backend processes the file and returns a localized draft.

2. Localized Draft Editing
WYSIWYG Editor:
The localized email is rendered visually, block by block, using a rich text editor (e.g., Froala).
Each block is editable and outlined, maintaining the original HTML structure.
Info Buttons:
Every block has an "i" button, opening a side panel with:
The original text
Change highlights (what was replaced/added)
Rationale and compliance notes
Reference mapping and traceability

3. Reference Management
References Section:
At the end of the document, all references cited in the content are listed.
If a reference is changed in any block, it is highlighted in the references section for compliance and auditability.

4. Advanced Editing Tools (Left Drawer)
Drawer with Three Modes:
DOM/Structure View (Stack Icon):
Shows a hierarchical tree of the HTML document for navigation and block selection.
Style/Properties Editor (Pencil Icon):
Allows users to edit CSS classes and properties (dimensions, typography, decorations, flex, etc.) for the selected block.
Block/Element Library (Plus Icon):
Lets users insert new layout elements (columns, text, images, videos, links, etc.) into the document via drag-and-drop or click-to-insert.

5. Versioning & Comparison
Compare Drafts:
Users can compare different versions/drafts of the localized document, ensuring changes are tracked and justified.

6. Submission & Approval
Submit for Approval:
Once satisfied, users can submit the localized draft for review/approval.

7. UI/UX Principles
Modern, clean, and intuitive interface
Transparency and traceability for every change
Compliance and audit-readiness (especially for regulated content)
Powerful editing and customization tools for advanced users

Tech Stack
React.js (front-end framework)
TailwindCSS (styling)
Froala Editor (WYSIWYG editing)
React Context/Redux (state management)
Axios/Fetch (API communication)
react-toastify (notifications)

In summary:
This is a robust, user-friendly platform for uploading, localizing, editing, and managing HTML email content, with a strong focus on compliance, transparency, and advanced editing capabilities.
