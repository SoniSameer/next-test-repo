UI Analysis: Left Drawer Pencil Icon (Style/Properties Editor)

Overall Layout
Left Drawer:
The drawer is now in a different mode, focused on editing the properties and styles of the selected element in the document.
The top of the drawer shows the pencil icon as active/selected.

Drawer Content
1. Classes Section
Classes Input:
There’s a field labeled "Classes" where you can add, remove, or refresh CSS classes for the selected element.
Example: reader-web is applied as a class to the selected element.
There’s a dropdown for "State" (likely for pseudo-classes like :hover, :active, etc.).
The currently selected element is shown (e.g., Div #xix372).

2. Settings/Properties Sections
Accordion Panels:
Multiple collapsible sections for editing different CSS properties:
Setting
General
Dimension
Typography
Decorations
Extra
Flex
Each section can be expanded to reveal more controls (e.g., sliders, color pickers, input fields) for adjusting the corresponding CSS properties.

Main Editor Area
Localized Content:
The right side remains the WYSIWYG editor with the localized document.
The selected block is visually highlighted, and any style changes made in the left drawer will be reflected live in the editor.

Functionality
Element Styling:
The user can directly manipulate the appearance and layout of the selected element by:
Adding/removing CSS classes
Adjusting properties like size, color, font, spacing, flexbox, etc.
Live Preview:
Changes are immediately visible in the main editor area.

Element Selection:
The drawer updates based on which element is selected in the document.

Summary
The pencil icon mode in the left drawer is a style/properties editor for the selected HTML element.
It allows granular control over the look and feel of each block, similar to what you’d find in website builders or advanced WYSIWYG editors.
This is useful for power users who need to fine-tune the design and layout of localized content.
